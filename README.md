# Mental Health Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a project in which I am applying Exploratory Data Analysis for my Data Science class at The Bridge. The objective of this project is to analyze a series of public data frames on mental health that collect information globally from 1990 to 2017, to discover if there are differences based on geographical location, historical moment, gender, income level...

# Datasets

* 'prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder': Indicates the prevalence of different mental disorders by country and year.
* 'prevalence-of-depression-males-vs-females': Indicates the prevalence of depression in men and women by country and year.
* 'share-with-depression': Indicates the total prevalence of depression by country and year.
* 'share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders': Indicates the total prevalence (summing all mental disorders) by country and year.
* 'share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders': Indicates the total prevalence (summing all mental disorders) in men and women by country and year.

In addition to country-specific information, all these datasets include information grouped by continents and income levels (high, low, upper-middle, lower-middle).
